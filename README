This is a project worked on by computer engineering students at KTH. We are developing a quiz website using react redux.

What we have done is deployed the React app to firebase, we setup the code to fetch data from the quiz api and made our first simple quiz with a question and answer
that shows if you have chosen the right answer. 
What we also have done is setup the basic redux react structure with for example a counter reducer and a store.

What we plan to do in the future is create the backend functionality using redux. 
This includes being able to change the hash state and make custom events that changes 
questions and answers. We also want to make a leaderboard and being able to choose another type of quiz.

Our project file structure is made up of views, presenters, states and reducers. We have a store were we store all the data and 
reducers that changes the state of that data. Views shows all the components in the UI, presenters communicates with the view and also dispatches an action
to the reducer and gets updated in the store.
